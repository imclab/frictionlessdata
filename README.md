Building a **frictionless** data ecosystem.

# The Vision

Story: there's too much friction working with data - friction getting data, friction processing data, friction sharing data.

This friction stops people doing stuff - stops them creating, sharing, collaborating, using (especially amongst distributed communities). It kills the cycles of find, improve, share that would make for a real open data ecosystem.

We think getting some key pieces in place can reduce friction enough to lead to a step-change (revolution) in how the (open) data ecosystem operates with massively improved quality, utilization and sharing of data.

Network effects will matter: look at the adoption of a package manager (e.g. npm) or a particular tool. Creating a critical mass of use around the tooling and standards will be critical.


## What do we want to do?

- Infrastructure and tools
- Patterns and standards
- Outreach and adoption. Network effects matter and ecosystem currently very balkanized (there's the R folks over here, the data portals over there, the map-reduce folks over there ...)

Data Package standard - the "Data Package" project

- The basic pattern for preparing data
- Mininum viable standard
- Extensible to tabular and geodata
- Documentation and complementary tools are essential

Publish and "Install" - the "Registry and Tool" project

- Integrate (plugins etc) - its got to be incredibly easy to use "packaged" data
- The value add e.g. dependencies
- Data more diverse than code so more work here

Provide key data - the "Datasets Project"

- Helps to socialize and demonstrate data package
- Source of data to use (high quality, needed and useful)

Process, clean, fix, store - the "Infrastructure Project"

- More miscellaneous than other "projects" but important
- Process, cleaning storing etc are tied together (storage and fixing are related - versioning, patching etc)
- High quality data is important (little incentive to use or improve if most data is bad data)

## Principles

From first Frictionless Data post

* Lightweight
* Simple
* Web oriented
* Distributed
* Collaborative

## Stories and Analogies

* with logistics for ingredients for cooking (cf [Frictionless Post][friction]).
* Analogy with libraries and packaging in code
