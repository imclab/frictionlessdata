Building a **frictionless** data ecosystem.

# The Vision

What's the idea? What's the story?

Analogy with libraries and packaging in code.

What are we doing? Trying to transform the data ecosystem - unleash sharing, collaboration. The "library" transformation.

Key metaphor: frictionless data - non-linear / breakthrough / revolution

Data Package standard - the "Data Package" project

- Socialize and instructions
  - tabular data
  - geodata

Publish and Install - the "Registry and Tool" project

- Data more diverse than code
- Integrate (plugins etc)

Provide key data - the "Datasets Project"
- Socialize data package
- Needed and useful

Process, clean, fix, store - the "Infrastructure Project"
- These are tied together (storage and fixing are related - versioning, patching etc)
- High quality data (no good if we just get bad data)

## Principles

From first Frictionless Data post

* Lightweight
* Simple
* Web oriented
* Distributed
* Collaborative

## Learning how to do things

Infrastructure

* Datastore
  * syncing
* Converters
* Issues
* Modelling and Validation (?)
* Tool integration
